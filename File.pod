detects the basename of the raw file across MacOS, Windows, and Unix/Linux 
platforms.

=head2 sub platform

Uses a subset of the functionality of HTTP::Headers::UserAgent to determine
the type of machine that uploaded the file.



=head2 sub upload

Upload RAW_FILE to the local disk to a specified PATH, or to /tmp if PATH
is not specified.

    Returns the basename of the uploaded file;


As of version 3.1, there are two new args to upload():

=over 4 

=item * $debug

A third argument, C<$debug>, if non-zero will send
debugging information to STDERR. 

=item * $kludge

A fourth argument, C<$kludge>, if non-zero, will also write
the read data to a file in the temp directory.
